            <h2>Guitar History 101:</h2>
            <p>The guitar is one of the most popular musical instruments played today, most likely due to it's versatility, cost, and ability to harmonize with other instruments or be played solo. The guitar has truly survived the tests of time, with evidence of the first guitars dating back to almost 4,000 years ago.</p>

            <p>Evidence of the first stringed instruments, <u>tanburs</u> and bowl harps, can be traced back to over 3500 years ago from ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, and Egyption civilizations. It is hypothesized that the word for 'guitar' comes from the Greek κιθάρα (kithara).</p>

            <p>As the tanbur continued to develop in the Arabian countries, the <u>lute</u> and oud were introduced - primarily in the European countries. The lute had a curved back and came in a variety of shapes and sizes, had frets that segmented the neck of the instrument into different intervals, and was typically strummed with a quill feather.</p>

            <p>The Moors brought the <u>oud</u> along with them when they invaded Spain in 711. The oud is a short-necked pear shaped stringed instrument that lacked frets. The oud and the Arabic style of playing the instruments paved the way for future Medieval music and, ultimately, the guitar itself.</p>

            <p>Over time, the lute evolved to have up to 20 or 30 strings, but was slowly falling out of popularity.In Spain, fretted instruments with the familiar curved silhouette of the modern guitar began appearing around the 15th and 16th centuries. Eventually, the <u>Baroque guitar</u> surpassed the lute as the more favored instrument.</p>

            <p>The <u>vihuela</u>, which began being developed during the 15th century set the stage for the Spanish guitar through to the 1800's. These spanish guitars set the standard for what we now know as the traditional guitar: a 6 stringed instrument with an hourglass body, played with one hand in front of the hole in the body.</p>

            <p>Spanish musician, Antonio de Torres Jurado, began designing the style of guitar that would pave the way for all modern guitars. Another Spanish musician, Andres Segovia, iterated on Torres' design and established it as a concert instrument, thus introducing the <u>classical guitar</u> to the world!</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, in the United States, Christian Frederick Martin made the first flat-top acoustic guitar. Because Martin used steel strings, the body of the guitar had to be adjusted to handle the stress generated by the strings. The strings also lead to the changes in play style, introducing the use of a guitar pick to play the guitar.</p>

            <p>Near the end of the 19th century, Orville Gibson created the archtop acoustic guitar. Gibson's guitar design, where the body was shaped closer to that of a cello, allowed the instrument to produce a louder sound. The guitars were soon adopted by jazz and country musicians, and later by big bands and swing bands.</p>

            <p>After several decades of different people attempting to amplify the guitar's sound using microphones or transmitters, Adolph Rickenbacker, an electrical engineer, finally cracked the code and created the first <u>electric guitar</u>. Using an electromagnetic device, Rickenbacker converted the vibrations of the guitar strings into clear sounds.</p>
